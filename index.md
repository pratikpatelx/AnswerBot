## Welcome to AnswerBot
This project is for our COMP 4060 - Data Driven Software engineering class at UOFM. The collaborators for this project are [Swetul Patel](https://github.com/swetul)
and [Pratik Patel](https://github.com/pratikpatelx). 

This project is based on the reasearch paper AnswerBot: automated generation of answer summary to developers technical questions [Please Click Here To Open The Research Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3155562.3155650)

This website will contain all our design implementations for AnswerBot and other details required for our project. That is State Diagrams, Architecture diagrams, UML diagrams etc.

The Project Proposal Can be Found At: <a href="https://github.com/pratikpatelx/AnswerBot/blob/main/pdfs/COMP_4060-Project_Proposal.pdf" target="_blank">Project Proposal.</a>

To develop the project we are using a three-stage framework approach:

1. Relevant Question Retrival
2. Useful Answer Paragraphs Selection
3. Diverse Answer Summary Generation
